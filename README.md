Few comprehensive sessions of physical fitness awareness were conducted. 
Standardized physical fitness measurements of various workout routines of all participants were recorded before and after the awareness programs. 
Descriptive statistics were used to explore the test variables.  
We also personally contact the volunteers to test the effects of awareness programs on fitness exercise and health of visitors.
It was revealed that Physical fitness awareness had significant and positive effects on volunteer's mental and physical health.
